# synack.d's GNU/Linux Dotfiles
This repository contains all of my dotfiles for various flavors of GNU/Linux. They have
corresponding [etcfiles](https://github.com/synackd/etcfiles). Each theme is located on
a different branch, with my current "daily driver" dotfiles located in
``sandbox/<hostname>``. Enjoy!

## cyber
A cyberpunk/synthwave theme.

## basic
These were my first dotfiles when I first installed Arch. As the directory name states,
they are quite basic. Uses FontAwesome for the i3status bar.

## powerline
This is the second go-around on the same laptop which uses i3blocks with a powerline theme.

# synack.d's GNU/Linux Dotfiles
This repository contains all of my dotfiles for various flavors of GNU/Linux.

## Arch
### basic
These were my first dotfiles when I first installed Arch. As the directory name states,
they are quite basic. Uses FontAwesome for the i3status bar.

### powerline
This is the second go-around on the same laptop which uses i3blocks with a powerline theme.
